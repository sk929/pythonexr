Functions Applied to Functions
Here's something that's powerful, though it can feel very abstract at first. You can supply functions as arguments to other functions. Some example may make this clearer:

def mult_by_five(x):
    return 5 * x

def call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on arg"""
    return fn(arg)

def squared_call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on the result of calling fn on arg"""
    return fn(fn(arg))

print(
    call(mult_by_five, 1),
    squared_call(mult_by_five, 1), 
    sep='\n', # '\n' is the newline character - it starts a new line
)
5
25
Functions that operate on other functions are called "Higher order functions." You probably won't write your own for a little while. But there are higher order functions built into Python that you might find useful to call.

Here's an interesting example using the max function.

By default, max returns the largest of its arguments. But if we pass in a function using the optional key argument, it returns the argument x that maximizes key(x) (aka the 'argmax').

def mod_5(x):
    """Return the remainder of x after dividing by 5"""
    return x % 5

print(
    'Which number is biggest?',
    max(100, 51, 14),
    'Which number is the biggest modulo 5?',
    max(100, 51, 14, key=mod_5),
    sep='\n',
)
Which number is biggest?
100
Which number is the biggest modulo 5?
14
